## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks ```. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample.csv')
df.head()
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/sammple.csv')
df.head()
```
